Here's a random smattering of things I find neet.
-------------------------------------------------

#### [Vim](https://vim.sourceforge.io)
(that's right emacs guys)

#### [Homebrew](https://brew.sh)
Because the App Store is lame.

#### [Hashicorp](https://www.hashicorp.com)
Vagrant is my best friend and Vault is pretty nifty too. Chances are you've
heard of these guys before, right?

#### [Python](http://www.python.org) and [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org)
Why choose?

#### [Puppet](https://www.puppetlabs.org)
OK, this is really why I listed Ruby.

#### [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.org)
Lul, no the [Lunix](http://www.adequacy.org/stories/2001.12.2.42056.2147.html) [one](https://www.ubuntu.com)


#### [David Bowie](http://www.davidbowie.com/?frontpage=true)
I can say nothing that hasn't already been said. One of the best.


#### [llap goch](http://www.llapgoch.org.uk)
Seize the hidden power of the Welsh.
